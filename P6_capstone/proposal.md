### Domain Background

Music is an essential part of our daily life. Music can improve our mood, reduce our stress, provide us comfort. For the last few decades, music is also applied to some therapies to cure psychological problems. Music has a long history, starting from acient people using stones to make some sound to nowadays people invented thousands of instruments or devices to create attractive melody. The problem of how to create good music perpelxes people all the time, especially for people who don't have enough knowledge of music theories. 

Music has different types, such as Jazz, Blues, Classic. Same type of  music always has something in common. Machine learning is then a good approach to look into the inner connection. With the common part, it is possible to compose the music with the machine. Or even, we can combine different types of music together and create something new. I'm a big fan of music without the ability to compose. With machine learning, I might compose my first song.

### Problem Statement

The problem to be investigated here is how to use machine learning to compose a classic song. Some sample classic songs will be used as the training data and a model will be generated which can be used to compose a new song. The input data(song) needs some preprocessing before it can be used for training. During the training, a "memory cell" value should be passed down for multiple time steps. Finally, the model should be able to compose a song which sounds the same style of the input songs.

### Datasets and Inputs
_(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)_

In this section, the dataset(s) and/or input(s) being considered for the project should be thoroughly described, such as how they relate to the problem and why they should be used. Information such as how the dataset or input is (was) obtained, and the characteristics of the dataset or input, should be included with relevant references and citations as necessary It should be clear how the dataset(s) or input(s) will be used in the project and whether their use is appropriate given the context of the problem.

### Solution Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Benchmark Model
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.

### Evaluation Metrics
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).

### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.
